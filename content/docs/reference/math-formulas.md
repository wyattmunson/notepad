## Convert Temperature

### Quick C to F Conversions

Use these approximations to quickly convert between C and F for daily use.

**From C to F**: Double it and add 30

```math {.text-center}
\left (  x\ast 2 \right ) + 30
```

**From F to C**: Drop 30 and halve it

```math {.text-center}
\frac{x - 30}{2}
```

## Geometry

### Area

**Area of Rectangle**

```math {.text-center}
A = l \times w
```

Area of square: a^2
Perimeter of square: 4a
Where `a` is the length of one side

Triangle

- Area: `1/2 x b x h`
- Where `b` is base, and `h` is height

Circle:

- Area: `πr^2`
- Circumference: `2πr`
- Where: `r` is radius

## Compounding Interest Rate

```math {.text-center}
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
```

Where:

- A = the amount of money accumulated after tt years, including interest.
- PP = the principal amount (the initial sum of money).
- rr = the annual interest rate (decimal).
- nn = the number of times interest is compounded per year.
- tt = the number of years.

## Aircraft MPG

Aircraft MPG = Total Gallons Burned / Total Miles Flown​

### Seat Miles

Seat Miles=1,200miles×127filled seats=152,400seat-miles

Total Gallons Burned = Seat Miles / MPG per Seat

Aircraft MPG = Total Miles Flown / Total Gallons Burned
